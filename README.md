## Description

Welcome to my portfolio, showcasing the skills and knowledge I've gained through my Front End Web Developer Bootcamp. This portfolio serves as a reflection of my expertise and a gateway to the world of web development. Throughout this project, I've delved into HTML structures, implemented CSS flexbox and grid layouts, ensured responsiveness for various devices (laptops and mobiles), and incorporated smooth navigation linking to scroll to specific sections of the UI.
